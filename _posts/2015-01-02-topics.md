We welcome any talk proposals about Rust-related projects.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- The Rust language
    - Recent features and future roadmap
    - Architecting large projects
- Rust usage across FLOSS projects (Tor, VLC, Gnome, Firefox, etc.)
- Projects written in Rust (show and tell, architecture and API design)
- Tooling
    - Build tools (cargo, clippy, rustfmt, etc.)
    - Packaging libraries and executables written in Rust
    - Profiling, FFI, etc.
- Documentation and education initiatives
- Community initiatives
    - How to contribute
    - RFC process

Slots will be allocated for short (20 minutes) and long (40 minutes) talks.

Speakers need to specify their preferred format. Both include time for questions and answers.

Depending on number of submissions and topics, submitters could be asked for a different format instead.
